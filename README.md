## Run Locally

To run the application on your local machine, make sure to set the required environment variables at line 6.

Once you've provided the necessary environment variables, go to the application folder, install the required dependencies, and run the application.

```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Run on Cloud

For cloud deployment, drop a Service Account JSON file named `keys.json` into the project root directory. The Service Account should be given the following permissions: `BigQuery Admin`, `Cloud Functions Admin`, `Service Account User`, `Storage Admin`.

Navigate into the terraform directory, trigger off Terraform's initialization, and apply the configuration files.

```
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The production URL will be displayed as output in the console.
